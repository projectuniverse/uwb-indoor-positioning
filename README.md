# UWB Indoor Positioning

This project is an Android app that allows for indoor positioning of UWB-capable Android devices. The app requires a second UWB-capable Android device which acts as a UWB anchor. Using the fixed position of this anchor, this app calculates coordinates of Android devices within the anchor's range, allowing for significantly more accurate coordinates compared to GPS coordinates. The calculated positions are displayed visually and get compared to GPS coordinates on Google Maps.
